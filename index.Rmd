abstract: "*Rana boylii* is an imperiled frog species native to CA and OR, and it is currently designated as a species of special concern (CDFW) in the state of CA. It has been petitioned as candidate for federal (USFWS) and state (CDFW) listing. As a lotic breeding amphibian, *R. boylii* is tied closely to local flow regimes in the watersheds it inhabits and is therefore particularly sensitive to alterations to the natural flow regime. Effective conservation management of this species should consider and prioritize maintenance of genetic diversity as part of any listing decision because it is closely related to the evolutionary capacity for adaptation to environmental changes. Conservation of genetic diversity in this species will require several components, including refining potential conservation units (i.e., distinct population segments) and quantifying of genetic diversity and genetic diversity trajectories across the species range. To assess these components, fine-scale and landscape-scale analyses were conducted using genomic data from over 600 samples from 89 localities across the range of the species. Six genomically-distinct groups were identified, as well as population subdivisions at local watershed scales. One major impact on *R. boylii* populations has been river regulation. River regulation has been implicated as a cause of fundamental changes to downstream aquatic ecosystems. Regulation changes the natural flow regime which may restrict population connectivity and decrease genetic diversity in some species. Since population connectivity and the maintenance of genetic diversity are fundamental drivers of long-term persistence, understanding the extent that river regulation impacts these critical attributes of genetic health is an important goal. However, the extent to which *R. boylii* populations in regulated rivers have maintained connectivity and genetic diversity is unknown. The impacts of river regulation on *R. boylii* were investigated with genomic data to explore the potential for long-term persistence of *R. boylii* under continued regulation. *R. boylii* in regulated rivers showed striking patterns of isolation and trajectories of genetic diversity loss relative to unregulated rivers. For example, river regulation explained the greatest amount of variance in population genetic differentiation compared with other covariates including geographic distance. Importantly, patterns of connectivity and genetic diversity loss were observed regardless of regulation level but were most prominent in locations with the greatest regulation intensity. Using the same genomic data, fine-scale analyses of *R. boylii* and *R. sierrae* in a single region of the Sierra Nevada of California was conducted to evaluate the potential for hybridization between species. Hybridization between species may combine parental genotypes in ways that yield reproductively sterile or isolated lineages, and hybridization events may be short-lived and difficult to detect. Limited hybridization between the species was detected in the Feather basin, though it appears these are terminal events based on PCA, admixture, and tests of heterozygosity using species diagnostic SNPs. Finally, rangewide quantification and comparison of genomic variation across populations indicates the southern coast, southern Sierra Nevada, and Northern Sierra/Feather basin in California should have high prioritization in conservation efforts due to low genomic diversity and trajectories of diversity loss. More broadly, these results demonstrate both the critical need for regional conservation in a sentinel river species, and the utility and power of genetic methods for assessing and monitoring sensitive species across many scales."
acknowledgments: "For all the curious people who have come before and hopefully after, I want to acknowledge you, and I hope we can do better to inspire and support those voices that may not have had the opportunities or priviledge I have had. I am lucky to have had all I have had, and finishing a dissertation requires a community, and this dissertation would not have happened if it wasn’t for the amazing community of family, friends, and colleagues who helped me every step of the way. In particular, thank you to my partner, wife and best-friend Leslie—you are my sun and gravity—you held me together, anchored our family, and made it possible to run this crazy academic ultra-marathon. To my dearest little tadpoles, Connor and Genevieve, you inspire me, you make me laugh every day, and you remind me the world still has hope as long as we nourish joy and curiosity. Thank you for being you, and I hope one day you forgive me for the amount of time I’ve spent staring at a computer. Thanks to my mom for all the support, love, and baked goods. Sibling, thank you for consistently inspiring me, listening to me, and being the best sibling one could ask for. And for all my close friends, bandmates, and officemates (you know who you are), you keep me sane, you motivate me, and you remind me every day that I really love this crazy journey. John, your shed and couch have probably single-handedly kept me anchored in ways I can't even express...also your friendship. Thank you for your time, humor, and general levity. Thanks to my Dad, who has cajoled, pestered, and annoyed me for far too long to “get a PhD”, thanks for believing it was possible even when I didn’t. Also, please never suggest anything like this again. And to my committee and my colleagues at the Center for Watershed Sciences, you have all been an amazing resource in providing feedback, guidance, and support throughout my graduate student career. Finally, to my cohort and fellow students in the GGE, this has been a great place to grow and mature as a scientist and researcher. Thank you all."
