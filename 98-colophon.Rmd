The template meets  [UC Davis Graduate Studies dissertation requirements as of Fall 2018](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/resources/graduate-student-resources/academic-information-and-services/filing-thesis-or-dissertation) to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. Other elements of the document formatting source code have been taken from the [Latex, Knitr, and RMarkdown templates for UC Berkeley's graduate thesis](https://github.com/stevenpollack/ucbthesis), and [Dissertate: a LaTeX dissertation template to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, and NYU](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate).
